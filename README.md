### Explanation Video: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Yqa3PsRek2Y)

### Description:
This is a python GUI-based project to calculate the value of any word by giving each letter a numeric value based on their order in the alphabet.

### Modules Used:
- re (regular expression)
- customtkinter (to make it GUI)

### How It Works:
Users can write any word in the entry field and then hit the green button to check the value of the word. To make it more engaging, there is a history where all the previusly words checked are shown. The history gets automatically cleared when the program closes. The *help?* button pops up a help window where the functionality of the program is explained.
